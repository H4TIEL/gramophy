### Features

- YouTube Playback
- YouTube Download
- Smooth and Material Design Based UI
- Other things which you can expect from a decent music player made by a 15 y.o.

### Platforms Supported

For now, only windows. I need to tweak it a little bit and a real Mac/Linux Machine for making binaries. If you're have a mac (im poor, cant afford one) or a linux pc and really want to run this on your pc, please contribute, by building custom JREs. Contact me or join the discord server if you want to :)

### How to use?

1. Download binaries from [here]( https://github.com/dubbadhar/gramophy/releases ).
2. Or, you can compile from source.
3. Or, you can download only the [jar]( https://github.com/dubbadhar/gramophy/blob/master/out/artifacts/Gramophy_jar/Gramophy.jar?raw=true). Then download `playlists` , `config` , `ffmpeg.exe`, `youtube-dl.exe` and place them and the downloaded jar in the same folder. Then you can use your own jdk/jre to run it. **Can't guarantee whether it will work perfectly!**
